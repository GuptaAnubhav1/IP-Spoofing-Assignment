# IP-Spoofing-Assignment
IP-Spoofing Assignment

Your task is to write a Python 3 program that makes use of scapy to implement IP spoofing against a TCP server listening on a lab machine. You must implement the spoofing from a virtual machine running under VirtualBox on the same host as the TCP server. The spoofing attack will cause the victim machine to believe it has an established connection with an arbitrary IP address of the attacker's choosing.

This video demonstrates the attack in action. The video shows:

The network settings on the virtual machine (you should copy these),
normal connection establishment by a client to the server,
spoofed connections generated by the ip.py program.
